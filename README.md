🛠️ Phase 1: Basics & Environment
This initial stage focuses more on understanding the basics of Git & GitHub and developing hands-on proficiency with version control workflows.

It includes working on branch isolation, synchronizing local changes with GitHub, and resolving conflicts to maintain a clean repository state.

It also includes the foundational programs, such as profit/loss percentage calcuations and temperature conversion, focusing on the precise use of variables, data types and arithmetic operators.
